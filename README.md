# UCLA_M196
Repository for the class M196: Real World, Applied Data Science taught by Rishov Chatterjee and Claire Kim for 2020 UCLA Splash.

Duration: 2 Hours

Course Description:

- How you can apply data science to change your life
- How can you use maps to describe the impact of solar in California? (Guest speaker)
- How can you use data science to prevent bullying?
- How can you use data science to make money while you're sleeping?
- How do self driving cars work?
- How can data science help you improve your mental health?

In this class, you will learn to solve real world issues with data science in a hands-on manner. We will develop an an end-to-end workflow which involves the use of Python programming, data collection, exploratory data analysis, geographic information systems (GIS), data visualization, data transformation, cloud computing and framework design. Machine Learning will be adopted to some extent from an understandable point of view, but actual predictive model development will take place in the Machine Learning course.

- Students are encouraged to bring their own computers.

- Course will have two guest speakers:
  1. Juan Vasquez (City of Los Angeles)
  2. Contextual Normalcy Representative (Feminist.AI)

Projects:

1. Geospatial Exploration of Culinary Hangouts in Close Proximity of High Schools (Development Required)
2. Detecting Hate Speech from Tweets (Development Required)
3. Mental Health AI Solutions: Collaboration Between ChanR and Feminist.AI (Discussion)  

Development Workflow:

1. Local Implementations on Projects 1 and 2 with Functional Design in Python v3.
2. Migrate all implementations and relevant data stores to ChanR Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Instance.
3. Establish public Jupyter interface on GCP for students to interact with.
