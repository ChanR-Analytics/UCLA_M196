In this class, you will learn to solve real world issues with data science in a hands-on manner. We will develop an an end-to-end workflow which involves the use of Python programming, data collection, exploratory data analysis, geographic information systems (GIS), data visualization, data transformation, cloud computing and framework design. Machine Learning will be adopted to some extent from an understandable point of view, but actual predictive model development will take place in the Machine Learning course.

- Students are encouraged to bring their own computers.
